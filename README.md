# Candlestick Pattern

Candlestick Pattern is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It isn't based on any of the standard indicators. Its main purpose is to detect and mark Japanese candle patterns directly on the chart.

A small pannel can be used to turn detection on and off or to wipe the detected patterns.

It supports notifications via email, mobile, and the platform's popup window.
